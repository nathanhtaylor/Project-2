      <description>Author: Nathan Taylor Cats are domesticated predators that went from dangerous hunters to wimpy and fat pets (by wimpy and fat I mean cool and suave). They are independent jerks that depend on us for their food (and we depend on them to defend us).

      <description>Author: Eddie Alvarado Ferret Facts  The word ferret is from the Latin fur, meaning little thief. Indeed, one of the ferrets favorite activities is stealing and hiding things. Ferrets belong to the weasel (Mustelidae) family. Besides weasels and ferrets, this group of animals also includes minks, otters, and badgers as well as polecats and sables. An endangered species of ferrets previously thought to extinct, the black-footed ferret, was recently rediscovered in America.</description>
